        <p style={{textAlign: 'left'}}>Welcome to our little ripoff of <a href='https://keeptalkinggame.com/'>Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,</a> made entirely in React! Here's how to play:<br/>
          A round of the game has one driver and any number of teammates, each accessing this site via their own device. The game starts when the driver presses 'Play'.<br/>
          On the game page, the driver will see a timer, a point counter, and several puzzles. While each puzzle exists, the points counter will increase based on its
          Triage level: <br/>
          <span style={{backgroundColor: 'red', color: 'black'}}>Red puzzles are your highest priority</span><br/>
          <span style={{backgroundColor: 'yellow', color: 'black'}}>Yellow puzzles are your second highest priority</span><br/>
          <span style={{backgroundColor: 'green', color: 'black'}}>Green puzzles are your lowest priority</span><br/>
          But they all matter!<br/>
          <span style={{fontSize: '50px'}}>Your goal is to get the lowest score possible!</span><br/>
          The bar below your points total tells you how fast your score is increasing. Keep that bar small and green.<br/><br/>
          The puzzles all have their own set of cryptic clues. We won't tell you exactly how to solve them, but your teammates can: <br/>
          Anyone assisting in the game should click the 'Manual' button on their own device. That manual contains all of the information you need
          to solve every puzzle - if you know how to read it. <br/>
          Good Luck, and we hope to see you on the <Link to='/scores'>Leaderboard!</Link>
